Description: Most human genes have multiple promoters that control the 
  expression of different isoforms. The use of these alternative promoters 
  enables the regulation of isoform expression pre-transcriptionally. 
  Alternative promoters have been found to be important in a wide number of cell
  types and diseases. proActiv is an R package that enables the analysis of 
  promoters from RNA-seq data. proActiv uses aligned reads as input, and 
  generates counts and normalized promoter activity estimates for each annotated
  promoter. In particular, proActiv accepts junction files from TopHat2 or STAR 
  or BAM files as inputs. These estimates can then be used to identify which 
  promoter is active, which promoter is inactive, and which promoters change 
  their activity across conditions. proActiv also allows visualization of 
  promoter activity across conditions.
