CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.3
------------------------

+ plotPromoters is deprecated
+ Implemented three new functions
  - plotPCA: performs principal component analysis
  - plotHeatmap: heatmap visualization
  - integrateProactiv: integrate different proActiv runs

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.22
------------------------

+ Update package-down site
+ Update NEWS for Bioconductor 3.13

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.18
------------------------

+ Gene expression data is now stored in the assays of the summarizedExperiment 
object returned by proActiv to facilitate easier filtering of the 
summarizedExperiment object. The metadata slot is now empty. 
+ Plotting promoter activity: Implementation of boxplotPromoters function to 
plot boxplots of absolute promoter activity, relative promoter activity, and
gene expression.
+ Identification of alternative promoters: Implementation of 
getAlternativePromoters, used to identify promoters that may exhibit alternative
usage.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.15
------------------------

+ Implement getAlternativePromoters for identifying alternative promoters
+ Implement boxplotPromoters for visualizing promoter usage

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.6
------------------------

+ Enforce condition vector to following naming conventions

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.0
